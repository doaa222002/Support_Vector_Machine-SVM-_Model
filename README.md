# Support_Vector_Machine-SVM-_Model
This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that identifies optimal hyperplanes to separate data points in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring robust performance on complex datasets with clear decision boundaries.
